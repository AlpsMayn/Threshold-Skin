This option brings back the forward button on the main steam window. This only works with the Expanded Sidebar.
Show Forward Button brings back the forward button, while Hide Forward Button reverts back to the default, hidden button.
Note: Even when set to be show, the button is invisible while disabled, so you'll only see it when you can actually go forward.

To install, copy the contents of the appropriate folder to the root of the skin (where config.ini is). Confirm you want to replace files, then restart steam.
