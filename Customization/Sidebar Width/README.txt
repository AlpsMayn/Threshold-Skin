This option changes the size of the sidebar on the main steam window. 
Collapsed Sidebar is shrunk, while Expanded Sidebar is the default, larger size.

To install, copy the contents of the appropriate folder to the root of the skin (where config.ini is). Confirm you want to replace files, then restart steam.
