Windows 10 accent themes generally have two colors; one for the base accent and one that is darker (back button).
The regular Accent is generally "Accent" and the darker Accent is generally "Accent2".
There are also additional colors from the back button's hover and selected states, which may or may not be used depending on user preference.

Because text may need to be colored on top of the accent (updating game list text, disk usage graph, etc) we need a color that doesn't look terrible.
"AccentInv", "AccentText", and "AccentTextHover" are permutations of this (for disk usage, update text, and hover update text respectively).
The default themes utilize complimentary colors for this purpose (EX: blue and orange) but this is not a requirement, only that they are not shades of gray.

"TitleBar", "TitleBar.Focus", "TitleBar.Accent", and "TitleBar.Accent.Hover" are all specific colors for the Accented Title Bar option. 
All are likely just previous colors, but these are seperate entities in case you want to specify a different color.
These options (with the exception of "TitleBar.Accent" and "TitleBar.Accent.Hover") are overwritten if the Accented Title Bar option is disabled.

"Notification.Back" is the background color of notifications. Be cautious changing this, as it could make icons/text difficult to read.
